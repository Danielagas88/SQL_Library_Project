# 📚 Digital Library SQL Project

This project simulates a digital library system using SQL.  
It includes tables for authors, books, readers, and book loans.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- `Authors`: Author ID, Name, Birth Year
- `Books`: Book ID, Title, Author, Genre, Year, Copies
- `Readers`: Reader ID, Name, Email
- `Loans`: Loan ID, Book ID, Reader ID, Loan Date, Return Date

## 📊 Example Queries

- Books by genre, loan statistics
- Readers who borrowed books of a specific genre

## 📎 Usage
